# Hi everyone

I'm a statistician and data scientist collaborating with the [Department of Hepatology](https://www.swissliver.ch/en/home), 
University Clinic for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, at the Inselspital University-Hospital Bern in Switzerland. <br>

I'm mostly working with R and C++. Currently working on way more open source packages than I could realistically handle all at once.<br>

You can read more about me on my totally outdated [website](https://jonas-schropp.github.io/), or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasschropp/?locale=en_US) or 
[Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonas-Schropp).
